This is the solution of stage 5

in the home directory use - ls
find "inhere"
use cd inhere/
use ls to see the files
we need to search for a human readable file, that is 1033 bytes, and is not executable.
To do this we need to use the find command with some options

the solution:

1) ls
2)cd inhere/
3)ls
4)find -readable â€“ size 1033c ! -executable
5)cat ./maybehere07/.file2
