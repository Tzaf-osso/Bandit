This is the solution of stage 6

we need to use find command to find:
1)user, which defines the file owner, bandit7
2)group, which defines the file group, bandit6 in this case
3)size, which defines the size of the file. 33c means 33 bytes of character
we need to search the file in the root directory with /
To do this we need to use the find command with some options

the solution:

1)find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c -type f 2>/dev/null
2)cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
